    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Faithful Haven isn’t just a community, it’s a space for healing, hope, and faith. 
      We welcome anyone going through mental health struggles, no matter your age, gender, or background. 
      Whether you’re in a dark place or simply seeking peace, you belong here.
      <br><br>
      This is a space for people who feel deeply, dream big, and sometimes feel lost or broken. 
      At Faithful Haven, we believe healing comes not just from professional help, but also from shared stories, 
      real connection, and growing in faith,together.
      <br><br>
      Let’s create a place where we lift each other up, see the world through new eyes, and remind each other 
      that even in the middle of pain, hope and healing are possible.

        <h3>Lomathemba Irene Qoma</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Lomathemba Irene Qoma, the person behind Faithful Haven. I’ve faced mental health struggles myself,
          and I know what it feels like to want healing but not know where to start. That’s why I started building 
          this space, a place where people can come together, be honest, and help each other heal through shared 
          experiences and faith.
          <br><br>
          I’ve always dreamed of starting this community before turning 18,not because I have all the answers, 
          but because I believe in the power of connection, love, and vulnerability. Faithful Haven isn’t launched yet, 
          but it’s in the making,and that’s okay. What matters is the heart behind it.
          <br><br>
          I hope this becomes a place where people feel heard, seen, and held,even if they’re still figuring things out, 
          just like me.
          <br><br>
          With love<br>
          Lomathemba Irene Qoma
